# mcbuilderwand #
Wand that allows buidling geometric shapes in bedrock minecraft

Hopefully it is self-explanatory. 

## Quick start ##
To install double click the mcaddon file

### Builder wand ###
1. Find the builder wand in the creative inventory.
2. Right click whilst look at the block you want to grab. 
3. Choose your option in the menu and do what is says.

### Bonus Emerald Block Pickaxe ###
If you are in survival mode this pickaxe breaks blocks super fast. Including bedrock.

## Issues
1. Sometimes it fails to detect the correct block. You can see what block it detected in the chat.
If it gets the wrong block then press cancel and try again, after slighty repositioning yourself.
IIRC it is better to look slightly down on the block.

2. For some reason though the package.ps1 script creates the zip and renames it to mcaddon, it does not install if created that way.
So currently to create a new mcaddon you need to manually zip up the behaviour and resource pack. If you only care about install the add on the
jsut use the supplied mcaddon le.
